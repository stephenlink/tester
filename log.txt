Lab 7:
1. First I checked the see the version of sort installed is an updated
version using the command:
sort --version
this gave me version 8.4 of sort which is more recent than 8.6, so we're
good

2. Next I created a file with 10M random numbers with the command:
od -An -t f8 -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > random.txt
this also replaced the new lines that were undesired

3. After this I measured the time it took to run multiple threads with
the sort command using the following line:
time -p /usr/local/cs/bin/sort -g --parallel=N random.txt > /dev/null
where N indicates the number of threads: 1, 2, 4, & 8 respectively

4. The time it took the run N number of threads is recorded below
as follows:

1 thread:
real 176.03
user 175.86
sys 0.24

2 threads:
real 94.95
user 181.34
sys 0.26

4 threads:
real 59.90
user 191.04
sys 0.35

8 threads:
real 39.01
user 203.87
sys 0.43

Results: As we can see, the more threads we use the faster speeds we get.
